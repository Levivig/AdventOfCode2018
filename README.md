# AdventOfCode2018

Being an iOS Developer I use Swift daily, but still I don't really know and use all the built in features of it. By solving these exercises my goal is to increase my pure Swift skills.


Usage
-----
### macOS
Just open the Xcode project select the target you want and hit run.<br>
The `run.sh` script will work too.

### Ubuntu
Run any day with the `run.sh` script.

#### Example
`./run.sh 1` will run day1.
